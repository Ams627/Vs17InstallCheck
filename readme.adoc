= Visual Studio 2017/2019 installation checker

This tool reports installations of Visual Studio. From Visual Studio 2017, it is possible to install multiple instances of Visual Studio on the same computer. You might
want to do this so that you have a different instance for each workload you develop for (e.g. an instance for desktop development and an instance for mobile development).

You can see all installed instances of Visual Studio by looking in the folder

----
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\VisualStudio\Packages\_Instances
----

In this folder you will see a subfolder for each instance:
